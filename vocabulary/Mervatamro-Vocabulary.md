# These are some of the terms I encountered
1. **checkout**
You can use git checkout on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch. The "checkout" action updates all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updates the index and HEAD if the whole working tree is pointing to a new branch.
2. **commit**
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).
