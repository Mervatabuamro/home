# These are some of the terms I encountered
1. **checkout**
You can use git checkout on the command line to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or even to switch to a different version of a file from a different branch. The "checkout" action updates all or part of the working tree with a tree object or blob from the object database, and updates the index and HEAD if the whole working tree is pointing to a new branch.

2. **commit**
A commit, or "revision", is an individual change to a file (or set of files).

3. **fork**
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository.

4. **SSH Key** refers to *Secure Shell Management*, is a special network protocol leveraging public-key cryptography to enable authorized users to remotely access a computer or other device via access credentials called SSH keys.
 
5. **remote**
This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

6. **remote repository**
A repository that is used to track the same project but resides somewhere else.
